# Design-and-Development-of-Autoencoders-to-Identify-Latent-Space-for-Protein-Dynamics

The aim of this project is to develop tools that can describe the temporal evolution of protein dynamics and thus help predict the structural changes that lead to changes in protein function. The tool can extract important input features from the contact maps of atoms in the input protein, or even the x, y and z coordinates of the atoms, and can successfully reconstruct the input to demonstrate that the latent space has learned all the important information from the input data. In addition, the project will use loss functions to determine the applicability of the model and the accuracy of the reconstructed images. The model implemented in this project is the CVAE with AEA model.

The code in this project can be downloaded and run directly.

Please see the comments within the code for specific input specifications.
